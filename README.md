# Manufacturing System

This is a public prototyping of a manufacturing system with the following goals:

1. Graph-based
2. Real-time
3. Open-source
4. Configurable

Traditional manufacturing systems separate ERP, MES, and SCADA into vertical software stacks that don't play nicely together. The primary data structure is a database table. The classic assumption is that everything follows a perfect, linear path, and nothing goes wrong and the customers never ask for anything special. Of course, that's not how real manufacturing works.

Here's how this repo works:

1. Write a note to think through the problem
2. Update a prototype to think through the problem
3. Repeat
